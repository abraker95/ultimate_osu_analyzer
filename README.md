## About

Python rewrite of my [old osu analyzer](https://github.com/abraker95/osu-Replay-Analyzer) that aims to be a lot more useful

The Ultimate osu! Analyzer is a gui for mass analysis of data. It's been made with the intent to collect beatmaps and replays to analyze correlations between patterns and player performance.

See the [tutorials](https://github.com/abraker95/ultimate_osu_analyzer/wiki/Tutorials) for info on how to use the analyzer.

## Run/Install

Download the repo. You can do so by "Clone or download" button on the right of the main page:

After downloading, extract the "ultimate_osu_analyzer-master" folder to your desired location. Next you will need to open cmd console. You can do so by typing in "cmd" in the address bar in the app folder and hitting enter:

If you have multiple Python versions installed, commands may differ slightly from min. But generally it will be either or similar variant of `pip`, `pip3`, or `pip37` and `python`, `python3`, or `python37`. If you still have issues running pip with multiple python versions installed, you can also do `python3 -m pip` as a replacement for `pip`.

First make sure you have all the needed libraries by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will download a bunch of libraries needed to run the app.

Run the app by running the command `python run.py`
